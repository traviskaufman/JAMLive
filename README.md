Crowd-Sourced Music Creation
----------------------------
JAMLive! Aspires to be a high-performant, interactive audio server that will
allow artists and musicians to collaborate with their audiences and allow them to make music with them.

It is being built using Scala/Play! in attempt to be resilient and scalable
such that it could possibly handle 100s of concurrent live TCP connections
and produce audio with minimal latency.
